# Intro to Systems and Networks Programming Challenge 1

**Objective:** Implement a threaded version of a matrix multiplication program.

**Summary:** The challenge involves implementing and extending a threaded matrix multiplication program, organizing the code with a makefile, and ensuring thread safety with mutexes. 

*Note: This code was written and tested on Mac and the directions are written based on that.* 

**Directions:**
    <ul>
    <li> Clone the Directory from the terminal: </li>
        **```git clone https://github.com/IamPoojaP/Intro-S-N-Programming-Challenge-1.git```**
    <li>Type **```make```** in the terminal </li>
    <li>**```./ThreadedMatrixMultiply```** to run it</li>
    </ul>
